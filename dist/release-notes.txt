RELEASE: v0.3.1

SKESA: 2.5.0

DESCRIPTION:

This is mainly a bug-fix release, with two minor but helpful features added to the stand-alone RAPT script (run_rapt.py): It now checks whether the docker daemon is running before attempting to launch the container, and prompt user with proper message if not; and a --network argument is added for users to specify a custom network for the container. This parameter is passed directly to the command line to run the container. Refer to documentation for 'docker run' command.
