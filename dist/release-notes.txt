DESCRIPTION:

This release, after a major refactoring and subject to automatic code-linting, provides a more robust build of RAPT. Some minor improvements include removing duplicated sequence file adding sequence assemble statistics, output messages during reference data download retrying and adding retry logic for internet retrieving processes that may have sporadic failures.
