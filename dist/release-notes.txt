DESCRIPTION:

The motivation for this release is to include a new PGAP version, which should speed RAPT up quite a bit. webRAPT now sends email notifications, accepts forward and reverse reads in two files, monitors user quotas, and verifies taxonomic data and accepts an argument to stop upon taxonomic disagreement. 

We have included bug fixes (in particular the invalid SRA index one), improved logging and error messaging, and cleaned up output files.
